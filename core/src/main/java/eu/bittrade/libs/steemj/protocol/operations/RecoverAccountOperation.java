     * Create a new recover account operation.
     * 
     * Recover an account to a new authority using a previous authority and
     * verification of the recovery account as proof of identity. This operation
     * can only succeed if there was a recovery request sent by the account's
     * recover account.
     *
     * In order to recover the account, the account holder must provide proof of
     * past ownership and proof of identity to the recovery account. Being able
     * to satisfy an owner authority that was used in the past 30 days is
     * sufficient to prove past ownership. The get_owner_history function in the
     * database API returns past owner authorities that are valid for account
     * recovery.
     *
     * Proving identity is an off chain contract between the account holder and
     * the recovery account. The recovery request contains a new authority which
     * must be satisfied by the account holder to regain control. The actual
     * process of verifying authority may become complicated, but that is an
     * application level concern, not a blockchain concern.
     *
     * This operation requires both the past and future owner authorities in the
     * operation because neither of them can be derived from the current chain
     * state. The operation must be signed by keys that satisfy both the new
     * owner authority and the recent owner authority. Failing either fails the
     * operation entirely.
     *
     * If a recovery request was made inadvertently, the account holder should
     * contact the recovery account to have the request deleted.
     *
     * The two step combination of the account recovery request and recover is
     * safe because the recovery account never has access to secrets of the
     * account to recover. They simply act as an on chain endorsement of off
     * chain identity. In other systems, a fork would be required to enforce
     * such off chain state. Additionally, an account cannot be permanently
     * recovered to the wrong account. While any owner authority from the past
     * 30 days can be used, including a compromised authority, the account can
     * be continually recovered until the recovery account is confident a
     * combination of uncompromised authorities were used to recover the
     * account. The actual process of verifying authority may become
     * complicated, but that is an application level concern, not the
     * blockchain's concern.
