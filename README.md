Please have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/marvin-we/steem-java-api-wrapper/wiki/How-to-add-SteemJ-to-your-project) to find examples for Maven, Ivy, Gradle and others.

# How to build the project
The project requires Maven and Java to be installed on your machine. It can be build with the default maven command:

>mvn clean package

The resulting JAR can be found in the target directory as usual. Please notice that some integration tests require different private keys. Please provide them as -D parameter or use the properties file ( *src/test/resources/accountDetailsUsedDuringTests.properties* ) to define them. If you do not want to execute tests at all add *"-Dmaven.test.skip"* to the mvn call which skips the test execution during the build.
